## KeyLogger

Keystroke logging is the process of recording (logging) the keys pressed on a keyboard (usually when the user is unaware). It is also known as keylogging or keyboard capturing.

These programs are used for troubleshooting technical problems with computers and business networks. It can also be used to monitor network usages but more often than not it is used for malicious intents like stealing passwords.The program illustrates in designing a keylogger for windows using PyCharm.

### Advantages of Keyloggers (Legitimate Use):

**Employee Monitoring:**
Employers can use keyloggers to monitor workplace activity and ensure that employees are using company resources responsibly and productively.

**Backup of Typed Information:**
Keyloggers can serve as a backup tool by logging all typed data. If something is accidentally deleted, a keylogger can help retrieve the lost information.

**Password Recovery:**
For users who forget their credentials, keyloggers can assist in recovering forgotten passwords or sensitive data that was previously typed.

### Advantages of Keyloggers (In Penetration Testing):

**User Activity Tracking for Research:**
In some cases, keyloggers are used in UX research or software testing to monitor user behavior patterns and improve user interfaces.

**Security Vulnerability Identification:**
Ethical hackers can use keyloggers to demonstrate security weaknesses in systems, showing how malicious actors might capture keystrokes and highlighting the need for stronger security controls like encryption.

**Testing Employee Awareness:**
In security awareness training, keyloggers can be used to simulate real attacks and test whether employees are aware of the risks of typing sensitive information on compromised devices.
